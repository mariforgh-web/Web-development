    <h1>Black hole</h1>
<p>A black hole is an object in space with gravity so strong that nothing can escape it, not even light. It forms when a very massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity. Black holes have a boundary called the event horizon, which is the point of no return—once something crosses it, it cannot get out. At the center is the singularity, where all the mass is squeezed into an extremely small space. Although black holes can destroy anything that gets too close, they are not dangerous unless you are near them. Scientists study black holes by observing the light and matter swirling around them, since black holes themselves cannot be seen.</p>

        <h3>About this book</h3>
        <p>      Black holes are among the most fascinating and extreme objects ever discovered
      in the universe. Formed from the collapse of massive stars, these regions of
      spacetime possess gravity so powerful that nothing—not even light—can escape.</p>
